# BLCSPresentation

## What Is This?

This is the markdown source _and_ the pdf and html output for the slideshow I am doing on _Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress_

## How To?

Open `main.html` or `main.pdf`. If you want to build from source, make sure you have [marp](https://marp.app/) installed and on `$PATH`. run
```
make run
```
to get a pdf and run
```
make html
```
to get html.

Once development is done, the project will be archived.
