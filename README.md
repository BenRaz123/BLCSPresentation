# BLCSPresentation

## What Is This?

This is the markdown source _and_ the pdf and html output for the slideshow I am doing on _Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress_

## How To?

Go to Code > Download Zip. Then unzip the project and open main.html. Enjoy!

### Building from source 

Make sure you have [marp](https://marp.app/) installed and on `$PATH`. run

```
make run
```
to get a pdf and run
```
make html
```
to get html.

Once development is done, the project will be archived.
